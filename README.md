### Abstract
The paper describes a deep neural network-based detector dedicated for ball and players detection in high resolution, long shot, video recordings of soccer matches. The detector, dubbed FootAndBall, has an efficient fully
convolutional architecture and can operate on input video stream with an arbitrary resolution. It produces ball
confidence map encoding the position of the detected ball, player confidence map and player bounding boxes
tensor encoding playersâ€™ positions and bounding boxes. The network uses Feature Pyramid Network desing
pattern, where lower level features with higher spatial resolution are combined with higher level features with
bigger receptive field. This improves discriminability of small objects (the ball) as larger visual context around
the object of interest is taken into account for the classification. Due to its specialized design, the network has
two orders of magnitude less parameters than a generic deep neural network-based object detector, such as
SSD or YOLO. This allows real-time processing of high resolution input video stream.

### Environment and Dependencies
* Ubuntu (18.04 or 20.04) with CUDA (10.1 or 10.2) + PyTorch (1.6 or above)

Other dependencies include:
* scipy
* opencv
* kornia
* PIL


### Datasets
Our model is mainly trained 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l4jGKES04iLq9b0CPlvIevaAN8YDZ2ne" target="_blank">using ISSIA-CNR Soccer dataset</a> 
(camera 1, 2, 3 and 3) 
and
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/lci/datasets/SoccerPlayerDetection_bmvc17_v1.zip" target="_blank">SoccerPlayerDetection_bmvc17_v1 dataset</a>
. 

### Training
To train our network, edit config.txt and set paths to training datasets.
Then, run:
    python train_detector.py --config config.txt


### Testing
The pre-trained model *model_20201019_1416_final.pth* is saved in `models/` folder.
To run the trained model use the following command:

    python run_detector --path datasets/issia/filmrole5.avi --weights models/model_20201019_1416_final.pth --out_video out_video.avi --device <cpu or cuda>

This will create a video with name given by *out_video* parameter with bounding boxes around the ball and 
players position. Detection confidence level (in 0..1 range) will be displayed above each bounding box.
